  <h1>Melanie Mohn</h1>

    <p>
      I’m a software engineer who’s spent nearly a decade building software across company sizes—from seed-stage startups to large enterprises—and across industries including finance, HR, education, and healthcare.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work at <a href="https://www.abridge.com/" target="_blank">Abridge</a>, shipping enterprise-grade software that transforms clinical conversations into structured documentation, so providers spend less time charting and more time caring for patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that, I worked at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> at the intersection of technology and education, helped scale <a href="https://workbravely.com" target="_blank">Bravely</a> as an early engineer, and got my start in engineering at J.P. Morgan Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a past life, I taught English and wrote literary criticism. The common theme between my academic work and my engineering career? <span class="oops">Syntax errors</span>.
